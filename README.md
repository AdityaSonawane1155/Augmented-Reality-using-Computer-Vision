# Augmented-Reality-using-Computer-Vision
The goal is to develop an algorithm capable of detecting ArUco markers in the images and accurately placing AR images in their respective positions. By leveraging computer vision techniques, particularly with libraries like OpenCV, the aim to seamlessly integrate digital content, such as a poster, into real-world environments. This involves precise marker detection to determine the 3D positioning of the scene, enabling the proper alignment of AR elements. Through this project, I seek to showcase the potential of augmented reality technology in enhancing interior spaces, providing insights into the practical application of computer vision for AR applications

Loading the Original Image: • image = cv2.imread(‘images/image 1.jpg’): This line loads an image named ’image 1.jpg’ from the ’images’ folder using the OpenCV function cv2.imread(). The loaded image is stored in the variable image.

Converting to Grayscale: • gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR BGR2GRAY): This line converts the loaded color image (image) to grayscale using the OpenCV function cv2.cvtColor(). Grayscale images are easier to process and reduce computational complexity.

Defining ArUco Dictionary and Parameters: • aruco dict =cv2.aruco.getPredefinedDictionary(cv2.aruco.DICT 6X6 250): Here, an ArUcodictionary is initialized using the function cv2.aruco.getPredefinedDictionary(). The dictionary type chosen is cv2.aruco.DICT 6X6 250, which specifies a dictionary of 6x6 ArUco markers with 250 unique IDs. • parameters = cv2.aruco.DetectorParameters(): Detector parameters are defined using the cv2.aruco.DetectorParameters() function. These parameters control the behavior of the ArUco marker detection algorithm, such as corner refinement and marker size thresholds.

Detecting Markers: • corners, ids, rejectedImgPoints = cv2.aruco.detectMarkers(gray, aruco dict, parameters=parameters): ArUco markers are detected in the grayscale image (gray) using the cv2.aruco.detectMarkers() function. This function returns the corners of detected markers (corners), their corresponding IDs (ids), and rejected points (rejectedImgPoints).
